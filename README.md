# Grant Review Cost Visualizer
This project provides an interactive tool to visualize the often-overlooked costs and time wasted on unfunded science grant applications. The current academic funding system requires substantial resources to prepare, review, and manage applications, yet only a small percentage of projects receive funding. This raises crucial questions:

- **How much time and money are lost on unsuccessful applications?**
- **Could the process be optimized to make scientific funding more efficient and less wasteful?**

By adjusting variables like funding rate, words required, hourly rate, and total applications, this tool aims to give a clearer picture of the true cost of the current funding system. It encourages reflection on potential inefficiencies and motivates discussion on how the system might be improved to better serve researchers and the scientific community.

## Features
- Adjustable parameters for words required, funding rate, hourly rate, and more.
- Visual charts showing total cost and time spent on unfunded applications.
- Easy-to-use interface for experimenting with different input values.
